    summary: |
      I developed a quasar-based model of supermassive black hole binary populations. Using this model I predicted the local number density of supermassive black hole binaries implied by the common red-noise process observed in NANOGrav's 12.5-year data set. I found the local number density would need to be five times larger than previously expected from simulations of galaxy mergers in ILLUSTRIS.

  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

J. Andrew Casey-Clyde is a doctoral candidate at the University of Connecticut, and visiting researcher at Yale University, who is developing multimessenger models of supermassive black hole binaries. His models combine information from the nanohertz gravitational wave background and quasars to constrain their relationship. He is also developing models of dual AGN populations tied to supermassive black hole binary merger rates. He is interested in developing self-consistent models of supermassive black hole growth and evolution.

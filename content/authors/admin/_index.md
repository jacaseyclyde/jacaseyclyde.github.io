      GPA: 3.823/4.000

      I developed statistical and computational models to analyze the nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB) and its connection to supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) using observational data. I found SMBHBs may be eight times more prevalent than expected, quasars up to seven times more likely to host SMBHBs, and identified a 16 nHz anomaly in the GWB spectrum (âˆ¼ 2Ïƒ confidence). I demonstrated expertise in data modeling, statistical inference, and analyzing complex datasets.

      GPA: 3.791/4.000

      Developed a computational model using a leapfrog integration scheme to simulate the orbit of dense molecular gas around our galaxyâ€™s central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Built a Bayesian analysis pipeline to fit the model to observational data, estimating the gas passes within âˆ¼ 5 lightyears of the SMBH. Demonstrated expertise in algorithm development, statistical modeling, and data analysis.

      I developed a quasar-based model of supermassive black hole binary populations. Using this model I predicted the local number density of supermassive black hole binaries implied by the common red-noise process observed in NANOGrav's 12.5-year data set. I found the local number density would need to be five times larger than previously expected from simulations of galaxy mergers in ILLUSTRIS.

  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

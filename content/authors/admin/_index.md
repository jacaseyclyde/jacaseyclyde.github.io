      The nanohertz gravitational wave background is thought to be dominated by gravitational waves from supermassive black hole binaries -- systems of two SMBHs which result from galaxy mergers. Quasars -- i.e., bright, accreting supermassive black holes -- have long been associated with galaxy mergers, suggesting a link with supermassive black hole binaries. In this work I developed novel models of the supermassive black hole binary population using observations of the gravitational wave background, quasars, and galaxies. I found that the gravitational wave background implies that supermassive black hole binaries may be eight times more numerous than previously expected. I further found that quasars may be up to seven times more likely to host a supermassive black hole bianry than random galaxies. Finally, I found an excursion in the spectrum of the GWB at 16 nHz which is louder than the average expected signal from supermassive black hole binaries at ~2Ïƒ confidence.

      I developed a data-driven model of gas orbiting the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. I used a leapfrog integration scheme to model gas orbits in the center of our galaxy. I then developed a Bayesian analysis pipeline to fit this model to kinematic data for gas observed in the center of our galaxy, finding the gas must have a peri-apsis distance of 1.3 parsecs from our central supermassive black hole.

      I developed a quasar-based model of supermassive black hole binary populations. Using this model I predicted the local number density of supermassive black hole binaries implied by the common red-noise process observed in NANOGrav's 12.5-year data set. I found the local number density would need to be five times larger than previously expected from simulations of galaxy mergers in ILLUSTRIS.

  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

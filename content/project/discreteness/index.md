ðŸš€ **Unlocking the Secrets of Gravitational Waves** ðŸŒŒ

As project lead for a collaboration of over 100 scientists, I investigated how patterns in gravitational wavesâ€”the ripples in space-time caused by merging supermassive black holesâ€”can reveal new insights about the Universe. Using data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, I built models to detect unexpected signals and studied how individual black hole pairs contribute to the larger wave background.  

ðŸ“Š **Key Outcomes:**
- Identified subtle deviations in wave patterns, possibly linked to individual black hole mergers.  
- Discovered a frequency range where signals from individual events or early-Universe phenomena could emerge.  
- Published our findings in a **top-tier journal**, highlighting their significance to the field.  

ðŸ’¡ **Relevance for Industry:** 
This project showcases my ability to transform complex, noisy datasets into meaningful insightsâ€”skills directly applicable to AI, machine learning, and predictive modeling challenges in industry.

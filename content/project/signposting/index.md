ðŸš€ **Using Quasars to Uncover Black Hole Pairs** ðŸŒŒ

As the lead on this project, I explored how quasarsâ€”exceptionally bright objects powered by black holesâ€”can help identify pairs of merging supermassive black holes. By integrating data from gravitational waves, quasar activity patterns, and galaxy observations, I developed a framework to estimate how often quasars host these black hole pairs.  

**Key Outcomes:**
- Found that quasars are up to **seven times more likely** than other galaxies to host black hole pairs, highlighting them as priority targets for future studies.  
- Improved regression analysis efficiency by **300x**, enabling faster and more scalable data analysis.  

**Why It Matters for Industry:**
This project demonstrates my ability to combine diverse datasets, optimize computational performance, and uncover insights in complex systemsâ€”skills directly relevant to data science, machine learning, and analytics roles.  

Letâ€™s connect to discuss how these approaches can solve challenges in your industry! ðŸŒŸ

abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found in the centers of massive galaxies,
  and galaxy mergers should eventually lead to SMBH mergers. Quasar activity has long
  been associated with galaxy mergers, so here we investigate if supermassive black
  hole binaries (SMBHBs) are preferentially found in quasars. Our multimessenger investigation
  folds together a gravitational wave background signal from NANOGrav, a sample of
  periodic AGN candidates from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, and a quasar
  mass function, to estimate an upper limit on the fraction of quasars which could
  host a SMBHB. We find at 95% confidence that quasars are at most seven times as
  likely to host a SMBHB as a random galaxy. Quasars should therefore be prioritized
  as targets for SMBHB searches in pulsar timing arrays.

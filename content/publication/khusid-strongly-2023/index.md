abstract: Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) should be the most powerful
  sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the universe. Once pulsar timing arrays
  (PTAs) detect the stochastic GW background from their cosmic merger history, searching
  for individually resolvable binaries will take on new importance. Since these individual
  SMBHBs are expected to be rare, here we explore how strong gravitational lensing
  can act as a tool for increasing their detection prospects by magnifying fainter
  sources and bringing them into view. Unlike for electromagnetic waves, when the
  geometric optics limit is nearly always valid, for GWs the wave-diffraction-interference
  effects can become important when the wavelength of the GWs is larger than the Schwarzchild
  radius of the lens, i.e., $M_mathrmlenssim 10textasciicircum8left(tfracfmathrmmHzright)textasciicircum-1,M_odot
  $ . For the GW frequency range explored in this work, the geometric optics limit
  holds. We investigate GW signals from SMBHBs that might be detectable with current
  and future PTAs under the assumption that quasars serve as bright beacons that signal
  a recent merger. Using the black hole mass function derived from quasars and a physically
  motivated magnification distribution, we expect to detect a few strongly lensed
  binary systems out to z $≈$ 2. Additionally, for a range of fixed magnifications
  2 $łeq$ $μ$ $łeq$ 100, strong lensing adds up to ~30 more detectable binaries for
  PTAs. Finally, we investigate the possibility of observing both time-delayed electromagnetic
  signals and GW signals from these strongly lensed binary systems-that will provide
  us with unprecedented multi-messenger insights into their orbital evolution.

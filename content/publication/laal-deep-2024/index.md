abstract: While supermassive black-hole (SMBH)-binaries are not the only viable source
  for the low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB) signal evidenced by the
  most recent pulsar timing array (PTA) data sets, they are expected to be the most
  likely. Thus, connecting the measured PTA GWB spectrum and the underlying physics
  governing the demographics and dynamics of SMBH-binaries is extremely important.
  Previously, Gaussian processes (GPs) and dense neural networks have been used to
  make such a connection by being built as conditional emulators; their input is some
  selected evolution or environmental SMBH-binary parameters and their output is the
  emulated mean and standard deviation of the GWB strain ensemble distribution over
  many Universes. In this paper, we use a normalizing flow (NF) emulator that is trained
  on the entirety of the GWB strain ensemble distribution, rather than only mean and
  standard deviation. As a result, we can predict strain distributions that mirror
  underlying simulations very closely while also capturing frequency covariances in
  the strain distributions as well as statistical complexities such as tails, non-Gaussianities,
  and multimodalities that are otherwise not learnable by existing techniques. In
  particular, we feature various comparisons between the NF-based emulator and the
  GP approach used extensively in past efforts. Our analyses conclude that the NF-based
  emulator not only outperforms GPs in the ease and computational cost of training
  but also outperforms in the fidelity of the emulated GWB strain ensemble distributions.

abstract: The nature of the gravitational wave background (GWB) is a key question
  in modern astrophysics and cosmology, with significant implications for understanding
  of the structure and evolution of the Universe. We demonstrate how cross-correlating
  large-scale structure (LSS) tracers with the GWB spatial anisotropies can extract
  a clear astrophysical imprint from the GWB signal. Focusing on the unresolved population
  of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) as the primary source for the GWB at
  nanohertz frequencies, we construct full-sky maps of galaxy distributions and characteristic
  strain of the GWB to explore the relationship between GWB anisotropies and the LSS.
  We find that at current pulsar timing array (PTA) sensitivities, very few loud SMBHBs
  act as Poisson-like noise. This results in anisotropies dominated by a small number
  of sources, making GWB maps where SMBHBs trace the LSS indistinguishable from a
  GWBs from a uniform distribution of SMBHBs. In contrast, we find that the bulk of
  the unresolved SMBHBs produce anisotropies which mirror the spatial distribution
  of galaxies, and thus trace the LSS. Importantly, we show that cross-correlations
  are required to retrieve a clear LSS imprint in the GWB. Specifically, we find this
  LSS signature can me measured at a $3sigma$ level in near-future PTA experiments
  that probe angular scales of $ell_textmax geq 42$, and $5sigma$ for $ell_textmax
  geq 72$. Our approach opens new avenues to employ the GWB as an LSS tracer, providing
  unique insights into SMBHB population models and the nature of the GWB itself. Our
  results motivate further exploration of potential synergies between next-generation
  PTA experiments and cosmological tracers of the LSS.

 abstract = {The nature of the gravitational wave background (GWB) is a key question in modern astrophysics and cosmology, with significant implications for understanding of the structure and evolution of the Universe. We demonstrate how cross-correlating large-scale structure (LSS) tracers with the GWB spatial anisotropies can extract a clear astrophysical imprint from the GWB signal. Focusing on the unresolved population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) as the primary source for the GWB at nanohertz frequencies, we construct full-sky maps of galaxy distributions and characteristic strain of the GWB to explore the relationship between GWB anisotropies and the LSS. We find that at current pulsar timing array (PTA) sensitivities, very few loud SMBHBs act as Poisson-like noise. This results in anisotropies dominated by a small number of sources, making GWB maps where SMBHBs trace the LSS indistinguishable from a GWBs from a uniform distribution of SMBHBs. In contrast, we find that the bulk of the unresolved SMBHBs produce anisotropies which mirror the spatial distribution of galaxies, and thus trace the LSS. Importantly, we show that cross-correlations are required to retrieve a clear LSS imprint in the GWB. Specifically, we find this LSS signature can me measured at a \$3\sigma\$ level in near-future PTA experiments that probe angular scales of \$\ell_\\text\max\\ \geq 42\$, and \$5\sigma\$ for \$\ell_\\text\max\\ \geq 72\$. Our approach opens new avenues to employ the GWB as an LSS tracer, providing unique insights into SMBHB population models and the nature of the GWB itself. Our results motivate further exploration of potential synergies between next-generation PTA experiments and cosmological tracers of the LSS.},

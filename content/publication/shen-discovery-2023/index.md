abstract: The hierarchical structure formation paradigm predicts the formation of
  pairs of supermassive black holes in merging galaxies. When both (or one) members
  of the SMBH pair are unobscured AGNs, the system can be identified as a dual (or
  offset) AGN. Quantifying the abundance of these AGN pairs as functions of separation,
  redshift and host properties is crucial to understanding SMBH formation and AGN
  fueling in the broad context of galaxy formation. The High Latitude Wide Area Survey
  with Roman, with its unprecedented combination of sensitivity, spatial resolution,
  area and NIR wavelength coverage, will revolutionize the study of galactic-scale
  environments of SMBH pairs. This white paper summarizes the science opportunities
  and technical requirements on the discovery and characterization of SMBH pairs down
  to galactic scales (i.e., less than tens of kpc) over broad ranges of redshift (11E42
  erg/s).

abstract: Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that are caused
  by events such as the merging of black holes. In principle, many types of events
  occur that could create gravitational waves with frequencies ranging from as high
  as a few kilohertz to as low as a few nanohertz. Sources of gravitational waves
  in the nanohertz frequency range include cosmic strings, quantum fluctuations from
  the early Universe, and, notably, supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Some
  gravitational wave sources are so numerous that they are all expected to contribute
  to a gravitational wave background (GWB). This GWB has been the target of pulsar
  timing arrays (PTAs) for decades.

abstract: With its capacity to observe $sim 10textasciicircum5-6$ faint active galactic
  nuclei (AGN) out to redshift $zapprox 6$, Roman is poised to reveal a population
  of $10textasciicircum4-6, rm M_odot$ black holes during an epoch of vigorous galaxy
  assembly. By measuring the light curves of a subset of these AGN and looking for
  periodicity, Roman can identify several hundred massive black hole binaries (MBHBs)
  with 5-12 day orbital periods, which emit copious gravitational radiation and will
  inevitably merge on timescales of $10textasciicircum3-5$ years. During the last
  few months of their merger, such binaries are observable with the Laser Interferometer
  Space Antenna (LISA), a joint ESA/NASA gravitational wave mission set to launch
  in the mid-2030s. Roman can thus find LISA precursors, provide uniquely robust constraints
  on the LISA source population, help identify the host galaxies of LISA mergers,
  and unlock the potential of multi-messenger astrophysics with massive black hole
  binaries.

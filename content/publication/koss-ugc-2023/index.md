abstract: We present multiwavelength high-spatial resolution (~0.$″$1, 70 pc) observations
  of UGC 4211 at z = 0.03474, a late-stage major galaxy merger at the closest nuclear
  separation yet found in near-IR imaging (0.$″$32, ~230 pc projected separation).
  Using Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, Very Large Telescope/MUSE+AO,
  Keck/OSIRIS+AO spectroscopy, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
  (ALMA) observations, we show that the spatial distribution, optical and near-infrared
  emission lines, and millimeter continuum emission are all consistent with both nuclei
  being powered by accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Our data, combined
  with common black hole mass prescriptions, suggest that both SMBHs have similar
  masses, $mathrmlogleft(M_mathrmBH/M_odot right)$ ~ 8.1 (south) and $mathrmlogleft(M_mathrmBH/M_odot
  right)$ ~ 8.3 (north), respectively. The projected separation of 230 pc (~6× the
  black hole sphere of influence) represents the closest-separation dual active galactic
  nuclei (AGN) studied to date with multiwavelength resolved spectroscopy and shows
  the potential of nuclear ($<$50 pc) continuum observations with ALMA to discover
  hidden growing SMBH pairs. While the exact occurrence rate of close-separation dual
  AGN is not yet known, it may be surprisingly high, given that UGC 4211 was found
  within a small, volume-limited sample of nearby hard X-ray detected AGN. Observations
  of dual SMBH binaries in the subkiloparsec regime at the final stages of dynamical
  friction provide important constraints for future gravitational wave observatories.

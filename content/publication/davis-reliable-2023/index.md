abstract: 'Periodic signatures in time-domain observations of quasars have been used
  to search for binary supermassive black holes. These searches, across existing time-domain
  surveys, have produced several hundred candidates. The general stochastic variability
  of quasars, however, can masquerade as a false-positive periodic signal, especially
  when monitoring cadence and duration are limited. In this work, we predict the detectability
  of binary supermassive black holes in the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey
  of Space and Time (LSST). We apply computationally inexpensive sinusoidal curve
  fits to millions of simulated LSST Deep Drilling Field light curves of both single,
  isolated quasars and binary quasars. Period and phase of simulated binary signals
  can generally be disentangled from quasar variability. Binary amplitude is overestimated
  and poorly recovered for two-thirds of potential binaries due to quasar accretion
  variability. Quasars with strong intrinsic variability can obscure a binary signal
  too much for recovery. We also find that the most luminous quasars mimic current
  binary candidate light curves and their properties: false positive rates are 60%
  for these quasars. The reliable recovery of binary period and phase for a wide range
  of input binary LSST light curves is promising for multi-messenger characterization
  of binary supermassive black holes. However, pure electromagnetic detections of
  binaries using photometric periodicity with amplitude greater than 0.1 magnitude
  will result in samples that are overwhelmed by false positives. This paper represents
  an important and computationally inexpensive way forward for understanding the true
  and false positive rates for binary candidates identified by Rubin.'

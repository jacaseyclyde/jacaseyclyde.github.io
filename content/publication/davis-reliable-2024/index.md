abstract: 'Periodic signatures in time-domain observations of quasars have been used
  to search for binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs). These searches, across existing
  time-domain surveys, have produced several hundred candidates. The general stochastic
  variability of quasars, however, can masquerade as a false-positive periodic signal,
  especially when monitoring cadence and duration are limited. In this work, we predict
  the detectability of binary SMBHs in the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey
  of Space and Time (LSST). We apply computationally inexpensive sinusoidal curve
  fits to millions of simulated LSST Deep Drilling Field light curves of both single,
  isolated quasars and binary quasars. The period and phase of simulated binary signals
  can generally be disentangled from quasar variability. Binary amplitude is overestimated
  and poorly recovered for two-thirds of potential binaries due to quasar accretion
  variability. Quasars with strong intrinsic variability can obscure a binary signal
  too much for recovery. We also find that the most luminous quasars mimic current
  binary candidate light curves and their properties: The false-positive rates are
  60% for these quasars. The reliable recovery of binary period and phase for a wide
  range of input binary LSST light curves is promising for multi-messenger characterization
  of binary SMBHs. However, pure electromagnetic detections of binaries using photometric
  periodicity with amplitude greater than 0.1 mag will result in samples that are
  overwhelmed by false positives. This paper represents an important and computationally
  inexpensive way forward for understanding the true and false-positive rates for
  binary candidates identified by Rubin.'

abstract: To date, most models of the stochastic gravitational wave background have
  built up the supermassive black hole binary population through modeling the merger
  histories of massive galaxies to z ~ 1. However, the recent discovery of the dual
  AGN J1010+1413 by Goulding et al. (2019) has opened up the possibility of using
  AGN population models as a proxy for massive black hole binary populations. We present
  the results of recent efforts to build on this model of the gravitational wave background
  by combining it with estimates of the local number of binary sources from Mingarelli
  et al. (2017), as well as an analysis of the volume and mass containing the background
  that is implied by such a model. We additionally compare this AGN proxy model of
  the massive black hole binary population to population models predicted by galactic
  merger models. Finally, we examine possible improvements that can be made to this
  model, including allowing the mass function to vary with redshift, as well as by
  allowing variations in the ratio of the binary and AGN population over redshift.
